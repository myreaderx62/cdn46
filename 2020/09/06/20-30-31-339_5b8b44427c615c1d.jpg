<p>Meet the Snot Snake: It’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/its-the-drag-that-helps-the-humble-hagfish-slime-predators-so-quickly/">the drag that helps</a> the humble hagfish slime predators so quickly. Hagfish can produce one liter of slime in mere fractions of a second.&#0160;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s a Critic: Intrepid scientist <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/intrepid-scientist-corrects-physiology-in-gullivers-travels-after-300-years/">corrects physiology</a> in <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> after 300 years. Jonathan Swift miscalculated some of the scaling in his 1726 satirical masterpiece. &quot;Kuroki gave a presentation on his analyses to his fellow book club members. They &#39;appreciated that they now had a better image of these fictitious peoples, but added that it was a unique but not necessarily proper viewpoint from which to consider this book. I agreed.&#39;&quot;</p>

We also get a first glimpse of Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s Mysterio—more ally than villain.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Here we go&quot;: Here’s the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/heres-the-action-packed-first-trailer-for-john-wick-chapter-3-parabellum/">action-packed first</a> trailer for <em>John Wick: Chapter 3—Parabellum</em>.

We&#39;re back after several weeks&#39; hiatus--although I still found time to write a special Twelve Days of Christmas series of science posts, plus a few others. And I&#39;ve thrown in some of the physics stories you may have missed over the holidays for good measure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The 12 Days of Christmas</strong></span>:</p>
